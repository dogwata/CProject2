<p>For this lab, you will create a website that uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery. This website can be for anything you want, but should not be similar to Lab 2.</p>
<p>Your main goal with this project is to connect to some API using JQuery, like what we did with Lab 2. You should find an open API (e.g. free, but perhaps requires registration), and write a site that uses this API to present the data.</p>
<p>You should look at this <a href="https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis">list of open APIs</a>.</p>
<h3>Pair Programming</h3>
<p>You are welcome to use pair programming for this assignment. With pair programming,  two students work together at one workstation. One takes the role of the "driver" and writes code while the other takes the role of the "observer" to review each line of code as it is typed in and offer suggestions. The two students switch roles frequently during the project. The two students should have relatively equal levels of experience.</p>
<p>Pair programming is <strong>not</strong> assigning different parts of the project to two different people, and then meeting later to put the work together. You <strong>must</strong> follow the above guidelines for pair programming.</p>
<p>We have provided an initial set of random pair programming partners for everyone. See this <a class="external" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wjIl3SX9PK3cjgZlZ8b1yBjDanyGjP3xohgCN57n0CA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><span>spreadsheet</span><span class="ui-icon ui-icon-extlink ui-icon-inline" title="Links to an external site." aria-hidden="true"></span></a>.  If you can, please work with this person. If you prefer, you can edit the sheet to setup a different partnership or to work alone.</p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>This is a creative project, so you are welcome to build what you would like. The basic requirements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The site uses JQuery to get data from an external API</li>
<li>The site contains a footer that links to your public GitHub repository</li>
</ul>
<p>The GitHub repository should be in your own GitHub account.</p>
<h3>Submission</h3>
<p>On Canvas, submit the URL for your website, which should be running on your DigitalOcean server. </p>
<p>You should also enter your name, your partner's name (if any), and your URL on this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fNs6PqfJViJNOZoODqIQbdeFSzFusxdFTHFTekINncQ/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet</a>. <strong>Be sure to select the appropriate tab at the bottom!</strong></p>
<h3>Rubric for Grading</h3>
<p>We will grade your projects based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>how clearly you present the data from the API</li>
<li>how well you follow web design principles: spacing, typography, color, consistency, and responsive design.</li>
</ul>
<p>TAs will assign scores in these ranges:</p>
<ul>
<li>90-100: Excellent presentation of data from the API, clearly follows web design principles</li>
<li>80-90: Uses an external API, good effort was made, but needs work to more clearly present the data or follow web design principles</li>
<li>70-80: Fulfills the minimum requirement of using an API, but does not make a strong effort to present the data clearly or follow web design principles</li>
</ul>
